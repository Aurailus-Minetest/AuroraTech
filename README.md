The Blink Launcher allows you to shoot a projectile, and then teleport to it. It can be refuelled by crafting it with Empowered Diamonds.

## Mining Laser

## Warp Boots

The Warp Boots allow you to propel yourself forward by double tapping W, even allowing you to warp through two meter thick walls. They do not need to be refuelled, instead breaking when they run out of durability.

## Drone Remote

The Drone Remote allows you to pilot a weaponized drone, and detonate it when finished.
